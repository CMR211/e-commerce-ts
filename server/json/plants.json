Alocasia Frydek brings out your inner child's need to want to touch everything soft and textural, but be gentle, as this indoor plant is tender! Alocasias generally love higher humidity levels and bright indirect light to grow and prosper. It is vital to water the soil when it is almost dry and drain any excess water from the bottom of the cover pot or grow pot to prevent the soil from being water-logged. If you follow these basic care requirements, your little Frydek might grow up to be 3 feet tall! This plant is toxic if ingested and may cause skin irritation. Keep away from pets and children.",
